# Build Plan - Quebec City Winter Itinerary Explorer

1. Extract and normalize content from `itinerary.md` into structured data groups (overview, travel, lodging, activities, food, packing, do-not-do).
2. Draft `index.html` with semantic sections, hero, navigation, and placeholders for the explorer, map, and content groups.
3. Implement the core visual theme in `styles.css` (color system, typography, layout grid, winter textures, responsive rules).
4. Build the interactive explorer in `app.js` (filters/tags, expandable cards, map pin linking, favorites).
5. Add offline handling (status banner, map fallback, graceful handling for external links) and polish micro-animations.
6. Test on desktop and mobile breakpoints, verify offline behavior, and refine spacing and readability.

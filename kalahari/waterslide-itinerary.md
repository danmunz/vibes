# **Kalahari Waterslide Y/N List**

# **🚫 Hard No Zone (skip without guilt)**

| Ride | Why you’re right |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Tanzanian Twister** | Pure vertical energy. It is basically a controlled betrayal. |
| **Zimbabwe Zipper** | Even worse. Near-free-fall. Not character-building — character-destroying. |
| **Sahara Sidewinder** | Big funnel drop \= stomach-in-throat moment. Looks fun, feels like falling into a blender. |
| **Screaming Hyena** | Drop capsule nonsense. Dad curiosity noted, Ava absolutely not. |
| **Anaconda** | The “water coaster” is secretly a tailbone tax. If your butt already filed a grievance, listen to it. |

# **⚠️ Borderline/Depends on Mood**

| Ride | Verdict |
| ----- | ----- |
| **VR Waterslide** | Physically tame, psychologically chaotic. If the headset doesn’t freak her out, this could be fun because the visuals replace the darkness. Try once only. |
| **Cheetah Racers** | Your instincts are right: dark \+ enclosed \+ fast \= betrayal. Skip unless she *asks* for it. |
| **Barreling Baboon** | The one fast dip is real, but everything after that is joyful swinging chaos. Good family raft ride if she’s feeling brave. |

# **✅ The *Awww Yisssss* Tier (prime Ava energy)**

These are basically **Ava’s exact vibe**: fast, twisty, visually open, no trauma.

| Ride | Why it’s perfect |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Smoke That Thunders** | Speed \+ curves \+ open feel. This is elite kid-confidence material. |
| **Serengeti Safari Adventure** | Twists into a bowl without terror drops. Big dopamine, low regret. |
| **Elephant’s Trunk** | The plot twist of the day — she loved it. That tells you she’s braver than she thinks. Keep riding it while the confidence is hot. |
| **Victoria Falls** | If Kate says yes, the council has spoken. Smooth family raft vibes. |
| **Kenya Korkscrew** | Excellent “not bad dot gif” energy — fast but not soul-threatening. |
| **Rippling Rhino** | Surprisingly fun, not scary. Strong yes meme potential. |
| **Zig Zag Zebra** | You’re right: she will like it. Or else. This is a clean, safe win. |
